# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface
This project uses DeepFace and OpenCV for real-time facial emotion detection. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and displays emotion labels on the screen. It's one of the shortest codes for real-time emotion tracking.

## Dependencies

- [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface): A deep learning library with pre-trained models for facial emotion detection, built on TensorFlow.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): An open-source computer vision library for processing images and videos.
